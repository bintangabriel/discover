In this repository, there are two branches: "Scraping" and "NLP processing" for summarizing the sources placed on the "bintang" branch. This is because NLTK (NLP framework) does not work well on Vercel (deployment hosting).

Then, in the main branch, it can simply fetch news from the "scraping and summarize" results.
